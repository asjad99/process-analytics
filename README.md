## Story: 

In this section we tell the following story: 



## Step 1: Process Mining in Practice 

## Exploratory Data Analysis + Analysis of specific process domain problems* *  



we  look at the topics most relvant to practiionars (process analysts). i.e how do process analysts conduct a process mining projects: 




There is a paper that surveys and describes how practitionars conduct a process mining project: 

 - **paper**:  Mining Process Mining Practices: An Exploratory Characterization of Information Needs in Process Analytics

   

* First, process models are used to visualize the **topology of the process or the control-flow**, respectively. In this regard, the frequency of activities and their connections is displayed as well. Second, meta-information primarily regarding activity and case attributes is captured in tables. Third, the major category of information needs is related to understanding the distribution of cases, activities, execution patterns, and durations, and is visualized using bar charts, tables or other techniques. Fourth, analysts also investigate the correlation between a broad range of attributes including execution patterns, items, durations, time points and organizational entities. This type of information is displayed in tables, dotted charts or other types of general-purpose techniques. 

* Commonly, those high-level domain problems are too complex to be straightforwardly answered by applying a single analysis technique, and thus analysts divide them into more fine-grain questions, leading to lower-level information needs that can be satisfied through the application of analysis techniques

* its an iterative process: A large share of the information needs also emerged during familiarization and discovery

* **where do analysts spend most of their time?** 

  - there are four main types of analysis. First, process models are used to **visualize the topology of the process or the control-flow**, respectively. In this regard, the frequency of activities and their connections is displayed as well. Second, meta-information primarily regarding activity and case attributes is captured in tables. Third, the major category of information needs is related to understanding the distribution of cases, activities, execution patterns, and durations, and is visualized using bar charts, tables or other techniques. Fourth, analysts also investigate the correlation between a broad range of attributes including execution patterns, items, durations, time points and organizational entities. This type of information is displayed in tables, dotted charts or other types of general-purpose techniques.

* Output: discovery of  ** the Process Model**? 

  

  * In our study, we observed that the most frequently examined problems are those referring to the analysis of perspectives other than the control-flow perspective,* ***especially the case perspective****. In this regard, our analysis revealed that the problems are largely explored via* ***visualization techniques*** *not specific to process mining, pointing to areas that might benefit more sophisticated analytical support. Additionally, the data revealed that discovery is a domain problem that organizations need to explore. Moreover, discovery is also often analyzed as part of the familiarization with the data in order to establish a basic understanding of the underlying process.*

  In the first edition in 2011, **discovery was the dominating domain problem**; it also was the problem that the analysts focused on the most in 2012, although the other **domain problems** started to receive increased attention. In the remaining editions the **case perspective** is the most frequently investigated problem. In this regard, 2018 is an exception where many information needs arose during familiarization and the case perspective ranked second. On average, the case perspective was the most important problem. A large share of the information needs also emerged during familiarization and discovery. Moreover, while conformance checking, prediction, and drift detection only played minor roles, the time and organizational perspectives were moderately important.

  

  | **Task**                                | **Task details**                                             |
  | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | **domain problems**                     | This set included the problems of process discovery where a process model describing the control flow is inferred from the data and of conformance checking which deals with verifying that the behavior in the event log adheres to a set of business rules, e.g., defined as a process model. While these two use cases focus on the control-flow perspective, there are three enhancement use cases which refer to other perspectives. |
  | **time perspective**                    | deal with understanding the performance of the process such as throughput times, working times or waiting times. <br> The *time perspective* is concerned with the timing and frequency of events. In most event logs, events have a timestamp (#*time*(e)). The granularity of these timestamps may vary. In some logs only date information is given, e.g., “30-12-2010”. Other event logs have timestamps with millisecond precision. The presence of timestamps enables the discovery of bottlenecks, the analysis of service levels, the monitoring of resource utilization, and the prediction of remaining processing times of running cases. |
  | **organizational perspective**          | focuses on the utilization of resources and their dependencies.  Organizational mining focuses on the *organizational perspective* [130, 159]. Start- ing point for organizational mining is typically the #*resource*(e) attribute present in most event logs.By analyzing an event log as shown in Table 9.3 it is possible to analyze the relation between resources and activities. Table 9.4 shows the mean number of times a resource performs an activity per case. <br/>**Social Network Analysis**<br/>Sociometry*, also referred to as sociography, refers to methods that present data on interpersonal relationships in graph or matrix form. <br/> **Discovering Organizational Structures** <br/>**Analyzing Resource Behavior** |
  | **case prespective** or decision mining | case perspective deals with the influence of other process attributes, e.g., related to the customer, on the behavior comprehending the influences of attributes on the process behavior <br>Section 9.5 showed how to use attributes in the log for decision mining. This shows which data is relevant and should be included in the model. |
  | **prediction problems**                 | where analysts aimed to create models that can forecast the development of process instances |
  | **drift detection** or Deviant analysis | aims to recognize points in time at which the underlying behavior of a process changed and to provide details regarding this change |
  | **familiarization**                     | is an activity that helps experts to understand basic characteristics of the business process and the event data |

  

  ## Step 2: Combine the analysis to get an Integrated Model (or an Enriched Model)  



Using organizational prespective, case prespective, and time prescpective to get a **integrated model** which provides a holistic view see figure below

control-flow model can be extended with additional perspectives extracted from the event log to ob- tain a fully integrated model covering all relevant aspects of the process at hand. 

TODO: link it to business process life-cycle 

The topics we covered were the ones with 3-4 good papers available 



## Step 3: **use simulations/what if analysis to improve performance:**  



Enrich the process model - Such an integrated model can be used for “what if” analysis using simulation.

| Matthias Weidlich            | My research focuses on specific types of information systems, those that are process-oriented and those that are event-driven. Such systems represent general-purpose technology with applications in diverse domains, reaching from health care through logistics to e-commerce. I am interested in formal methods for the specification and verification of information systems, their analysis based on log data, and techniques that optimise their run-time behaviour.
