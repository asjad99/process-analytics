| Marlon Dumas              | I conduct research in the field of information systems engineering. The problems I examine generally revolve around the following question: How to build and maintain information systems that are aligned with business operations? My efforts are currently focused on two approaches:<br><br><br>- Business Process Management: analysing and building software systems starting from models of how an organisation works, also called business process models<br>- Service-Oriented Computing: analysing and building software systems based on the metaphor of "software as a service", usually on top of Web technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Matthias Weidlich            | My research focuses on specific types of information systems, those that are process-oriented and those that are event-driven. Such systems represent general-purpose technology with applications in diverse domains, reaching from health care through logistics to e-commerce. I am interested in formal methods for the specification and verification of information systems, their analysis based on log data, and techniques that optimise their run-time behaviour. Specifically, I explore scenarios where process-oriented and event-based systems come together: where processes generate events or event processing technology supports the execution of a process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
